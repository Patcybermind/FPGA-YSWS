# FPGA-YSWS (non-official)
This project aims to provide an easy to understand learning path that takes people who dont know what binary is and turns them into someone capable of making something cool on their personal fpga.
This will be based on a specific FPGA development board to minimise problems like the classic "It works on my system but not on his!".
We will be making youtube tutorials with corresponding webpages on the official website so the user can choose depending on preference

If you wish to join the development of this project and you are under 19 join us at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) and join the #FPGA-YSWS-DEV channel or contact any of the contributors of this repository.
